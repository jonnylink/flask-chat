# Chat Wrapper
A super simple Python Flask server wrapper for OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude APIs for Funâ„¢

By default, ChatGPT is used.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and updating the values.
5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Requirements
1. ChatGPT API key
2. Anthropic API key (if using the Anthropic client)
3. Weather.com API key (if using the /what-to-wear route)
